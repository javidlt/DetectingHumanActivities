## Application Problem Definition: Detecting human activities from still images
- Detecting human activities from still images remains a relatively challenging area for computer vision.
Your task is to make use of a small portion of specifically selected images from MSCOCO, a large
resource of labeled photos used to train and evaluate many models in computer vision.
Your aim is to build a classifier that can successfully classify the specific images with the IDs provided in
MyAberdeen according to which human action is taking place in the image (e.g. sitting, standing).
The dataset includes multiple activity labels and multiple images. The image_ids are provided along with
the image urls that you can download from the MSCOCO website (full instructions in template code
provided).
